        question:'How do I book an appointment?', 
        answer: `Initially we will schedule a brief phone call prior to confirming your first appointment 
                to discuss your goals. If I feel I can meet your needs we might schedule an initial consultation together. 
                There are some severe mental health conditions that I am unable to care for in my private 
                practice and might require the expertise or resources of another clinician or facility.`

    {
        question:'What are your Payment Policies?', 
        answer: `Resource Family Psychiatry operates on a fee for service basis and does not participate 
        directly with insurance plans. This likely means that your visits with me will be considered 
        “out of network”. Payments would be made directly to Resource Family Psychiatry and, 
        depending on your insurance, all or a portion of your visit might be reimbursed by your insurance 
        company. You will be provided with a “superbill” which is a type of receipt that you can give to your 
        insurance company for reimbursement purposes. Please contact your insurance company directly to 
        determine your specific coverage and complete any necessary paperwork.`
